# Spanish gender paygap analysis
## Research objectives and motivation

The main objective of this repository is to analyze the gender paygap by gender in Spain. It is motivated by the more than obvious wage differences between men and women, and it is my particular way of shedding some light on this fact. In addition, a law was recently passed in Spain requiring companies to publish the salaries of their workers divided into categories. This law also adds that if the wage gap is m≈õ of 25%, the wage gap will be considered to be due to gender unless proven otherwise. Thus, this research will provide an exploratory analysis first, and later a regression study to try to show that the wage differences are not (or are) due to gender.

## Description of the data
First of all, and only to test the code, I will use the data from the four-yearly salary composition survey of the National Statistics Institute (INE) pertaining to the year 2014.
